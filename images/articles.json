Although, Russian troops have not reached the city yet, they have made gains since the start of the new offensive by controlling a confirmed 173.36 km\u00b2 of land in the North and have recently begun shelling the city. \n \n The Kyiv Independent has reported that some residents are refusing to evacuate the city, despite the danger, as they have adopted this war time environment into their way of life. One person reported asking a friend who is a resident of Kharkiv why they haven't left yet, to which they responded that 'I sowed the garden, but I'm in trouble, a rocket fell on the garden. So now I don't sow half the garden because the rocket is sticking out of the ground and it hasn't been neutralized yet. So I don't go close, but sow everything in front of the rocket'. 'That's how they live', the lady told The Counteroffensive, with a smile on her face. \n \n According to the head of the Bilopillia community, Yurii Zarko, it's mostly the elderly who are refusing to leave the city. They often argue that they were born here, this is their land their parents and grandparents lived here, and so they will die here. Some people are also used to living off their farmland and don't want to try living elsewhere, the Kyiv Independent stated."

Blinked stated that: \n \n 'Over the past few weeks, Ukraine came to us and asked for the authorization to use weapons that we're providing to defend against this aggression, including against Russian forces that are massing on the Russian side of the border and then attacking into Ukraine. And that went right to the President, and as you've heard, he's approved use of our weapons for that purpose'. \n \n This new policy will allow Ukranian military personnel to fire artillery and short-range rockets from HIMARS rocket launchers against command posts, arms depots, and other assets in Russian territory that are being used by Russian forces to carry out attacks on Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine. \n \n However, this does not grant Ukraine permission to fire longer-range ATACMS surface-to-surface missiles inside of Russia."

In the debris field,  parts of a missiles can be seen. Russian propaganda initially claimed that a civilian market was hit, but the location is neither civilian nor the debris seen on the pictures'. The images they are referencing are shown on slides 5-8. \n \n Actual footage that has been verified from the strike has been posted online by X account OSINTdefender, this includes three sepereate videos. The first is shown on slide 2 and shows a short clip of HIMARS being launched from their launchers. The descripton claims 8 different missiles were launched however the footage only appears to show 2. Despite this, these missiles were launched less than 24 hours after the US official removed restrictions on HIMAR missiles being used to strike targets in Russia. \n \n The next two videos are on slide 3 and 4 and show footage of the Russian Air Defence's S-300 missile systems in Belgarod firing missiles to intercept the HIMARS. Air-raid sirens can also be heard as the missiles travel near civilian areas. Although three flashes can be seen in the second video indicating possible interceptions by the S-300, it is known that a large quantity still got through and hit their intended targets. \n \n at 11:05AM another account on X run by an 'American in Ukraine' posted a tweet stating that 'Russian airfieilds are getting slaughtered by storm shadow missiles in both Belgorod and Kursk (Russia)'. \n \n These unconfirmed Storm Shadow strikes come hours after a BBC report stated that an anonymous military aviation officer stated that France had secretly allowed Ukraine to use their Scalp-EG/Storm Shadow missiles to hit airfields inside of Russia. It is key to note here that France has not officially announced this. \n \n The strikes are recent and due to fog of war and both sides opting to try and maintain operational secrecy and security, reports are few and no public officials on either side have released reports yet other than Russian officials falsly claiming Ukraine had struck the 'Shebekino market in Belgorod', PS01 on X stated. \n \n Additional footage of lots of air defense has been published with unverified claims of the footage being filmed in Belgarod. This video is shown on slide 9. The footage is filmed in the day which could indicate further attacks or could even support claims of more recent Storm Shadow/Scalp-EG strikes on airfields as the HIMARS strikes took place last night when it was dark."

In addition to this intel they also provided an insight stating that 'If the Russians manage to hold out for several days and bring up the main forces, then in this case Chasiv Yar will not last even a month'."
